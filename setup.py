descr   = """Sparse matrix tools.

This is a home for sparse matrix code in Python that plays well with
scipy.sparse, but that is somehow unsuitable for inclusion in scipy
proper. Usually this will be because it is released under the GPL.

So far we have a wrapper for the CHOLMOD library for sparse cholesky
decomposition. Further contributions are welcome!
